## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: QuestPay
- **Category**: defi

### Description
QuestPay is a decentralized milestone-based payment platform for freelancers and teams. It allows clients to lock funds into smart contracts and automatically release them once predefined milestones are met, solving the problem of trust and delayed payments in remote work.

### SL Integration  
QuestPay uses Soundness Layer to:
- Verify milestone completion through cryptographic proofs and oracle attestations
- Leverage SLâ€™s zk-proof APIs for dispute resolution without revealing sensitive project data
- Provide tamper-proof transaction logs accessible to both parties

## Technical

### Architecture
A React frontend interacts with a Node.js backend that manages smart contract deployment and communicates with SL APIs. Milestone data and proofs are stored on IPFS with references anchored on-chain. SL smart contracts handle verification and escrow logic.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + GraphQL  
- **Blockchain**: SL + Polygon
- **Storage**: IPFS + WALRUS

### Features
1. Create milestone-based escrow contracts
2. Submit & verify proofs of milestone completion using SL
3. Automated dispute resolution and transparent payment tracking

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic milestone contract creation
- [ ] SL integration for proof verification
- [ ] Simple user dashboard

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Full milestone escrow system
- [ ] Production-ready UI & backend
